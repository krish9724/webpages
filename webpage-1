  <h1>what is the construction and civil enginneering ?</h1>
  <h4>Construction and civil engineering involve the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure
    projects. Civil engineering focuses on the design and supervision of projects like bridges, roads, and water
    systems, while construction involves the actual building or assembly of structures based on these designs. Both
    fields play crucial roles in shaping the built environment and ensuring the functionality and safety of various
    structures and infrastructure.</h4>
